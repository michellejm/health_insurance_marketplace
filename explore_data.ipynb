If you choose to use an  out-of-network provider, services are not covered (except for  accidents and emergencies). \\nOur EPO network is serviced \\nby the Blue High Performance Network\\n® (BlueHPN®), which  \\nis a network developed by  Blue Cross to connect members with hospitals and doctors who provide high-quality, more affordable care in your community. This network is available for members in the seven-county Birmingham Metropolitan Statistical  Area (MSA).\\nPreferred Provider \\nOrganization (PPO)\\nA PPO is a type of health \\ninsurance plan that has a network of ‘preferred’ healthcare professionals that you can choose from throughout the nation. If you choose to use a non-preferred provider, you will usually pay more.EPO vs PPO\\nCalendar Year Deductible\\nThe amount you pay each January through December before your plan \\nbegins paying for certain covered medical services. Some medical costs you pay each year will not apply to the deductible, such as a doctor  visit copay. \\nCoinsuranceYour share of the costs of a covered healthcare service, calculated as a \\npercentage (for example, 20%) of the allowed amount for the service.  You pay coinsurance plus any deductibles you owe and the health insurance plan pays the rest of the allowed amount. \\nCopayThe fixed dollar amount you pay for certain medical services, prescription \\ndrugs or doctor visits at the time you receive care. \\nHealth Savings Account (HSA)An account established to pay for current and future medical expenses. \\nIt works together with an HSA-Qualified High Deductible Health Plan. You may use the money from your HSA to pay for deductibles, copays, coinsurance and other medical expenses. \\nOut-of-Pocket MaximumA cap on the amount of money that you are required to pay out of your \\npocket for your healthcare costs. This amount does not include your monthly premium. Once you reach the Out-of-Pocket Maximum,  eligible in-network services are covered at 100%. \\nPremiumThe monthly payment you make for healthcare coverage.
