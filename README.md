[Health Insurance Dataset](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-plan-information/)

In this project, I'm exploring the Federal Health Insurance Marketplace. The goal is to shed light onto how health insurance works in a variety of states and situations. Initial exploration of the dataset 

30 states are included in the federally run marketplace and 20 states use their own marketplaces. Of the states that use the federal marketplace, I wanted to know which states have the "best" (and worst) coverage options in terms of procedures covered, preventative medicine, copays, etc. However, when trying to download the plan brochures, the pdf scanner is very inconsistent. 

I might come back to this project to understand the relationship between marketplace health coverage and health outcomes
